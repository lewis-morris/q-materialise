Q-Materialise Documentation
=============================

Welcome to the documentation for **Q‑Materialise**, an enhanced
Material Design stylesheet library for Qt applications.  This project
is a redesign of the original `qt‑material <https://github.com/UN-GCPDS/qt-material>`_
library developed by the UN‑GCPDS team.  Q‑Materialise retains the
spirit of the original while offering a simplified API, better
customisation and improved readability.  This guide will walk you
through installation, usage and customisation.  If you're new to
the library we recommend starting with the :doc:`installation` and
:doc:`usage` pages.
